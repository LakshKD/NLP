This directory contains the Part of Speech Tagger developed by Lakshya and Arpan (IIT Bombay M.Tech CSE Students)

There are 3 folders that contain training model , Tagger and Testing.

Training model :->

----> Training Model folder contains the python code to train the model using viterbi algorithm and we have used the brown corpus for that.

----> Tagger folder contain the main "Part of Speech Tagger" that will accept the sentence having a space followed by a dot in the end, and it will output the pos tags.

----> Testing Folder contains the scripts to prepare the Test data and finally check the accuracy of the POS Tagger.

Enjoy Coding ,
